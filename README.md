# Unity Tutorial - Dialogue

In this tutorial, Brackey's shows the simplest way to make a NPC dialogue with easy coding. I never thought this would be another way to use a Queue. I chose this tutorial because Brackey's has the best possible method for doing something that sounds complicated and then shows us it isn't. My first choice was actually going to be his Cinemachine intro but it was more of showing what cinemachine had to offer than an actual tutorial.
